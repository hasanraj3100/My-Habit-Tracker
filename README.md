The app uses **Firebase Firestore** to store all user and habit-related data. The structure is organized for simplicity and scalability:

- **User Information**
  - Stored under: `users/{userId}/`
  - Contains personal details like name, gender, birthday, timezone, and profile settings.

- **Habits Information**
  - Stored under: `users/habits/{habitId}`
  - Each habit contains:
    - Title, description
    - Category
    - Frequency (daily/weekly/custom)
    - Current streak and history of completions

- **Categories**
  - Stored under: `users/settings/preferences`
  - Maintains a **string array of categories**, including predefined ones and any custom categories added by the user.

This structure ensures easy retrieval and filtering of habits, efficient tracking of progress, and flexible category management.
